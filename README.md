### Cybersecurity Enthusiast | B.S. in Computer Science (Expected Dec 2025)

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about cybersecurity and currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, expected to graduate in December 2025. Here, you'll find a collection of my projects, labs, and contributions that showcase my skills and interests in the field.


<h2>🔐 Cybersecurity Projects & Labs:</h2>

[SOC Simulation: Phishing and Firewall Response](https://github.com/Krystianczaja/SocAnalystPhishingLab)

  
  - This SOC Analyst lab simulates real-world alerts where I investigated a phishing email and a firewall block. I triaged alerts, verified threats safely in a VM, and documented findings, gaining hands-on experience with SOC workflows and tools like Splunk, TryHackMe, and TryDetectThis.

<h2>📜 Certificates</h2>
