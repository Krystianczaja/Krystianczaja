[SOC Simulation: Phishing and Firewall Response](https://github.com/Krystianczaja/SocAnalystPhishingLab)

  
  - This SOC Analyst lab simulates real-world alerts where I investigated a phishing email and a firewall block. I triaged alerts, verified threats safely in a VM, and documented findings, gaining hands-on experience with SOC workflows and tools like Splunk, TryHackMe, and TryDetectThis.
